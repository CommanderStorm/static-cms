## Overview

- **Name:** `markdown`
- **UI:** [Toast UI Editor](https://ui.toast.com/tui-editor)
- **Data type:** `markdown string`

The markdown widget provides a full fledged text editor allowing users to format text with features such as headings and blockquotes. Users can change their editing view with a handy toggle button.

_Please note:_ If you want to use your markdown editor to fill a markdown file contents after its frontmatter, you'll have to name the field `body` so the CMS recognizes it and saves the file accordingly.

## Widget options
