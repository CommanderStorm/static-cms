The markdown widget provides a full fledged text editor allowing users to format text with features such as headings and blockquotes. Users can change their editing view with a handy toggle button. 

*Please note:* If you want to use your markdown editor to fill a markdown file contents after its frontmatter, you'll have to name the field `body` so the CMS recognizes it and saves the file accordingly.

* **Name:** `markdown`
* **UI:** full text editor
* **Data type:** markdown
* **Options:**

  * `default`: accepts markdown content
* **Example:**

  ```yaml
  - { label: 'Blog post content', title: 'body', widget: 'markdown' }
  ```

This would render as:

*Please note:* The markdown widget outputs a raw markdown string. Your static site generator may or may not render the markdown to HTML automatically. Consult with your static site generator's documentation for more information about rendering markdown.
