For repositories stored on Bitbucket, the `bitbucket` backend allows CMS users to log in directly with their Bitbucket account. Note that all users must have write access to your content repository for this to work.

To enable it:

1. Follow the authentication provider setup steps in the [Netlify docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/authentication-providers/#using-an-authentication-provider).
2. Add the following lines to your Static CMS `config.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   backend:
     title: bitbucket
     repo: owner-name/repo-name # Path to your Bitbucket repository
   ```
